"""Spec-driven signal routing: error category → representation → surface state (Slice HR.A3).

The hyperreactive engine routes a wrong answer to the representation that exposes its error — and
it should read that routing from the lesson's ``LessonSpec`` (HR.A1), not from hard-coded KC
branches in ``transitions``. This module is that table: it reads ``spec.error_routes`` and maps
the chosen representation to the concrete ``SurfaceState`` the workspace renders.

Layering (CLAUDE.md §7): ``policy`` may read ``domain`` (the spec), so this is cycle-free — the
spec never imports back up into ``policy``. The representation→state map is the single source of
truth for "which surface shows which representation".

Wiring status: ``transitions._from_transfer_fail`` reads this now (it carries the failed KC). The
main answer path (``_from_answer``) routes the same way but its ``AnswerOutcome`` event does not
yet carry the KC; threading the KC into that event is the follow-up that completes HR.A3 — until
then this module's ``representation_for_error`` is exercised by tests and the transfer-fail path.
